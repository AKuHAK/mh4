With this program, you can extract and modify data (music, maps, sprites, etc.) from the game Heroes of Might and Magic IV (c)3DO & New World Computing.


When you extract files from a h4r file, a h4l file is written in the extraction directory. This file is used when you want to rebuild the h4r file.
You can edit it if you want (ascii file) but be carefull ...
If you want to build your own h4r file, extract all the files from an original h4r file, modify the files you want and rebuild the h4r file from the h4l file.
Be carefull, SAVE the original h4r file before any manipulation !!!

This program uses the following librairies:
	- QT 2.30 for the GUI (http://www.trolltech.com)
	- zlib 1.14 for the zip/unzip (http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html)
For compilation you may use microsoft Visual studio 6.0
Main project file: mh4.dsw


Special thanks to Gervan Peter who helps me to understand the h4r file format ...
